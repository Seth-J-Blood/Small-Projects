# Small-Projects
Smaller, standalone projects that I've completed that I deemed impressive enough for Github. These projects may have been made for a class, or just for fun.
Each project has its own directory and README file, which details how to run the code, what it does, why I made it, and what platform it was tested on.
Languages may include:
  * x86 Assembly
  * C/C++
  * Lua
  * Java

Feel free to take any of this code and run with it.
